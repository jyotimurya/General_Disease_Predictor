# General_Disease_Predictor

General Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Nowadays, when anyone suffers from any health-related issues, then the person has to visit a doctor which takes time and it is costly too. It has been observed mostly that every 2 months, over 70% of the population in India tends to general body disease like viral fever, cold and cough, etc. Since a lot of people don't realize that the symptoms of these regular ailments may be symptoms of something more dangerous, 25% of the population succumbs to death due to ignorance of the early-stage symptoms. Thus, the identification of the disease in the initial stages is important for the prevention of any unwarranted casualties. The medical system is mainly devoted to specific areas, known diseases and is insufficient to identify and accurately diseases based on early-stage symptoms. Also if the user/patient is not able to reach hospital and is unable to consult a doctor it may be difficult for the user/patient as the disease can not be identified. So, if the above problems are resolved by using an automated application that can be less time-consuming as well as money, it will be very helpful and easier for the user.
